.SH FORMATS
The recipe format consists of a metadata prelude, and steps.

In prelude lines,
anything before a colon is considered to be the name of a metadata field;
anything after the colon is a value to populate.
Lines without colons are continuations of the 'notes' field.
I suggest having at least a 'name' field.

A line starting with a hyphen ends the prelude and starts the first step. 

Each step is delimited by one or more blank lines.

Any line in a step starting with a space or a blank is an ingredient,
consisting of quantity, units, and the ingredient itself.

.B bread-calc
will attempt to guess at the type of ingredient,
but you can always force it by including 
one of the words 'flour', 'liquid', or 'additive' in the line.

Here is a brief example 
(note that github displays the indenting incorrectly):


.in +4
name: imaginary bread
.br
notes: This is a silly fake bread recipe
.br
makes: 1 bad loaf
.br
This line will become part of the notes
.br
---------------------
.br
Mix:
.in +4
500 g flour
.br
300 g water
.sp
.in -4
Bake at 375\(de
.in -4

.SH BUGS
It is cheerfully assumed that all units are grams.

It is undefined how 'liquid flour additive' is parsed,
but don't expect anything good.
