there are:
  baker's percentage formulas
    100 flour
      65 bread flour
      35 whole wheat
    2 salt
    60 water
    1.5 yeast
  recipes
    100 g flour, composed of
      65 g bread flour
      35 g whole wheat
    2 g salt
    60 g water
    1.5 g yeast
    yielding 163 g dough
We want to:
  get a formula from a recipe
  get a recipe from a formula and the quantity of any one of its components
  show a running weight target in an interactive session:
    65 g bread flour =  65 g total
    35 g ww flour    = 100 g total 
    2  g salt        = 102 g total
  make a recipe / formula from an interactive running weight target session

recipe-as-methods branch:
recipe is a hash: metadata, methods
  metadata is an extensible hash - :name, prep time, notes, history,
   serves, makes, attibution, etcc
  methods is a list of hashes, each composed of
   method, ingredients, optional 2nd method.
   
   method is a freeform string (any formatting can be done elsewhere)
   ingredients is a list of ingredients
     each ingredient is a hash - 
       qty, unit, name, bp_type(flour, liquid, additive)

converting a text recipe to a Recipe:
freeform prelude until /^-*/
a blank line starts a new Step
an indent means a new Ingredient
ingredient type is inferred by verbiage:
  flour: flour
  liquid: liquid
  water: liquid
  egg: liquid
  mashed: liquid
  milk : liquid
  dry: additive
  .*: additive
